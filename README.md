# Swing+, Power+, and Contact+: Composite Metrics for Evaluating Hitter Performance in Major League Baseball

This repository contains the research materials for my submission to the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (SSAC) 2026 Research Paper Competition.  

## Abstract
Major League Baseball began tracking swing speed during the 2023 All-Star Break, opening the door for new performance metrics. This project introduces **Swing+**, **Power+**, and **Contact+**, composite statistics designed to evaluate hitter performance by combining swing speed, launch angle, exit velocity, and outcome-based results into a normalized framework. These metrics provide a more holistic measure of hitter skill, contextualize decision-making at the plate, and extend beyond traditional batting statistics.

## Contents
- `/data`: Processed Statcast swing-level datasets (anonymized if needed)
- `/analysis`: RMarkdown scripts used to build and validate the metrics
- `/docs`: Technical deliverable, non-technical summary, and abstract
- `/presentation`: Final presentation slides

## Methods
- Data sourced from MLB Statcast (public)
- Regression modeling, weighted standardization, and composite index construction
- Validation through correlation with existing statistics (e.g., wOBA, WAR)

## Open Source Commitment
All code and documentation in this repository are open-source to support transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in advancing sports analytics.
